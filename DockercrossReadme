Dockercross dockerfile allows to build crosscompiled cif with binutils 
and other libraries to compile ARM programs. The script builds Ubuntu 
precise image with CIF installed in /work/cif directory. It can be taken
away from there and used in any other compatible Ubuntu system. For
instance, I have tested in Ubuntu 16.04. Worked with CIF 

1) Prepare clean directory and place there Dockercross file.
2) Rename Dockercross file into Dockerfile
3) Place repository or just sources in the directory next to the 
   Dockerfile. Directory should have name "cif".
4) Download, extract and place in the same directory with Dockerfile 
   rest project sources:
   
   a) binutils-2.26.1 (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/)
   b) gawk-4.0.2 (http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/gnu/gawk/)
   c) glibc-2.17 (http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/gnu/libc/)
   d) linux-3.7.3 (http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/)
   
5) Finally you should get directory with the following structure:
   ./
   |
   |-"binutils-2.26.1"
   |-"cif"
   |-"gawk-4.0.2"
   |-"glibc-2.17"
   |-"linux-3.7.3"
   |-"Dockerfile"
   
6) Install Docker in your system.

7) Execute:
   sudo docker build -t crosscif ./
   
8) After this you will get an image with crosscif.

9) Do not run CIF in docker since you will definetly get problems with
   various headers. Instead run it with a terminal and copy to some
   shared directory and use it as you usual CIF binaries.
   
10) To get CIF from docker image perfrom:

    docker run -v /abs/path/to/shared/host/dir/:/cross -ti --rm crosscif /bin/bash
    
    After that copy to your shared dir directory /work/cross
