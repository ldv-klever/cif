To build a debug version of Aspectator one needs create a separate directory
for it, say:
  $ mkdir aspectator-build-debug
  $ cd aspectator-build-debug
Then configure Aspectator as usual:
  $ ../aspectator/configure --enable-languages=c --disable-nls
and make the debug version of Aspectator (one can use -jN):
  $ make STAGE1_CFLAGS="-g3 -O0" all-stage1
After making some changes it is strongly recommended to rebuild the debug
version of Aspecatator with -Werror flag to treat all warnings as errors:
  $ make STAGE1_CFLAGS="-g3 -O0 -Werror" all-stage1

These instructions were adapted from http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebuggingGCC.
